System Goals: Role and Task Management System

Main Objectives:
1. Manage Roles
2. Manage Tasks
3. Visualize Tasks
4. Import/Export Task Lists
5. Manage Persons
6. Connect Roles, Tasks, and Persons
7. Provide User-specific Views

Detailed Description:

1. Manage Roles:
   The system will provide a comprehensive solution for managing roles within an organization. It will offer CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for roles, allowing administrators to define and maintain various positions or responsibilities within the system.

2. Manage Tasks:
   A robust task management feature will be implemented, supporting CRUD operations for tasks. The system will store detailed information for each task, including:
   - Bereich (Area)
   - Thema (Topic)
   - Kategorie (Category)
   - Aufgabe Titel (Task Title)
   - Aufgabe Zusammenfassung (Task Summary)
   - Kadenz (Cadence)
   - Verantwortung (Rolle) (Responsibility - Role)
   - Scope
   - Quelle der Aufgabe (Dokument und Absatz) (Task Source - Document and Paragraph)

3. Visualize Tasks:
   The system will provide an overview list of tasks, allowing users to quickly scan and understand the current workload and task distribution. This view will support sorting, filtering, and searching capabilities to enhance task management efficiency.

4. Import/Export Task Lists:
   To facilitate data exchange and backup, the system will support importing and exporting task lists in CSV format. This feature will enable easy migration of data and integration with other systems.

5. Manage Persons:
   The system will include a person management module with CRUD operations. This will allow the organization to maintain a database of individuals who can be assigned to roles and tasks.

6. Connect Roles, Tasks, and Persons:
   A key feature of the system will be the ability to create connections between roles, tasks, and persons. This includes:
   - Assigning tasks to specific roles
   - Matching persons to roles
   - Indirectly connecting persons to tasks through their assigned roles

7. Provide User-specific Views:
   The system will offer personalized views for each user, including:
   - "My Roles": A list of roles assigned to the logged-in user
   - "My Tasks": A comprehensive view of tasks associated with the user's assigned roles

Additional Project Details:

- Technology Stack:
  - Frontend: React-based web application
  - CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI design
  - Backend: Express.js server
  - Database: Firebase for real-time data storage and authentication
  - Development Environment: Vite for fast and efficient project setup and building

- User Interface:
  The system will feature an intuitive and responsive user interface, leveraging Tailwind CSS for consistent and attractive design across devices.

- Real-time Updates:
  Utilizing Firebase's real-time capabilities, the system will provide instant updates across all connected clients when data changes occur.

- Authentication and Authorization:
  Firebase authentication will be implemented to secure the application and ensure that users can only access and modify data according to their permissions.

- Scalability:
  The chosen technology stack (React, Express, Firebase) will allow for easy scalability as the user base and data volume grow.

- Offline Capabilities:
  Implement offline support to allow users to view and interact with their tasks and roles even when not connected to the internet, with synchronization occurring when the connection is restored.

- Reporting and Analytics:
  Include basic reporting features to provide insights into task distribution, role assignments, and overall system usage.

- Customization:
  Allow for some level of customization in terms of task fields, role definitions, and user interface layout to accommodate different organizational needs.

- API Integration:
  Develop a RESTful API to allow for potential future integrations with other systems or the development of mobile applications.

This Role and Task Management System aims to streamline organizational processes by providing a centralized platform for managing roles, tasks, and personnel. By offering clear visualizations, easy data import/export, and personalized views, the system will enhance productivity and clarity in task assignment and execution across the organization.

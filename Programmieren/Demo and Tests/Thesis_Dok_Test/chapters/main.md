# Chapter 2: Literature Review

This chapter aims to provide the necessary background from the current body of knowledge concerning AI agents, the system architectures they operate within, and the information structures that enable their complex reasoning and planning capabilities, particularly in the context of automating literature reviews. The initial sections focus on the state-of-the-art regarding AI agents (Section 2.1) and broader AI system architectures (Section 2.2), including cognitive and multi-agent approaches. Subsequently, the chapter explores information architecture (Section 2.3), emphasizing knowledge representation techniques like knowledge graphs and their synergy with Large Language Models (LLMs). The specific application context and challenges of automating literature reviews are then examined (Section 2.4). Finally, this chapter culminates in a research gap analysis (Section 2.5), identifying the specific contribution this thesis aims to make.

## 2.1 AI Agents: Concepts, Architectures, and Components
ðŸ“„ File: [`chapter2.1.json`](chapter2.1.json)

This chapter focuses on AI agents, exploring the fundamental concepts, architectures, and components that underpin their functionality. The chapter commences with a foundational definition of agentic AI in Section 2.1.1, clarifying its core attributes and differentiating it from non-agentic systems. Section 2.1.2 then examines the evolution of agent architectures, highlighting the significant impact of Large Language Models (LLMs). Subsequently, Section 2.1.3 dissects the essential components and common design patterns that constitute agentic systems. The chapter concludes with Section 2.1.4, which investigates various approaches to agent memory, a vital aspect for sustained operation and learning. This overview serves as a basis for the subsequent exploration of broader AI system architectures and information structures.
